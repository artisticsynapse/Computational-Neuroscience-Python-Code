# Computational-Neuroscience-Python-Code

As a part of ["Computational Neuroscience"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience) course offered by University of Washington, Seatlle, on Coursera, I've exercised coding in Python for solving questions in the course. Here are few Jupyter Notebooks (made interactive using Binder) involving problem statements (proposed as a part of quiz assesments by the above mentioned course), and their solutions (not provided by the courses, were supposed to be exercised by the students) in Python code: 

* **Information theory, and Neural Coding**: Plotting the tuning curves of neurons in the cercal organs of a cricket insect (click the Binder logo below to interact with the jupyter notebook): <br>
